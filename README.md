# 🌸 CodeAlpha - Iris Flower Classification

This project is developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship (Task 1)**.  
The goal of this task is to build a **machine learning model** that can classify Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements.



# 🧠 Project Overview

The **Iris dataset** contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species:

- *Iris-setosa*  
- *Iris-versicolor*  
- *Iris-virginica*

Each flower is described by four numerical features:
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

The objective is to train a model that predicts the correct species from these measurements.



## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

## 📊 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Imported the dataset (`Iris.csv`) and checked for missing values.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized pair plots and feature correlations.  
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets and applied feature scaling.  
4. **Model Building** – Trained a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score; plotted the confusion matrix.  
6. **Model Saving** – Saved the trained model as `iris_model.pkl` for future predictions.

## 📈 Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | ~97 – 99 % |
| **Algorithm** | Support Vector Machine (RBF kernel) |
| **Dataset Size** | 150 samples |


The model achieved excellent accuracy on the test data, clearly distinguishing among all three Iris species.
